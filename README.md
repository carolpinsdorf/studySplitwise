# studySplitwise
System created by a student (Carolina Dias Pinsdorf) to study logic when programming, using Python.

# This system will work in a similar way as "SplitWise app" works.
# It will receive the the name and the amount spent in group/party
# and it will do the math so everyone in the group had spent the same amount
# It will return the amount and to whom the person needs to transfer the
#  money, so they are all even in the end.
